# How to contribute

Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better! Please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Bug reports  

If something isn't working as expected for you, let us know by [posting an issue here](https://github.com/jaysnm/r-base/issues). When reporting your bug, please include some basic details:

- Details of your `operating system` and the version numbers of `docker` and other relevant software.
- Output from log console/files
- If a very similar bug has already been reported, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.  
  
You can also contribute by looking through the [existing issues](https://github.com/jaysnm/r-base/issues) and checking if the bug is reproducible, and if it's reproducible in other environments. Please add comments to report on your findings!

## Adding new features and changing the repository  

Proposals for new features, changes and editing or adding documentation are welcome.  


- Open an [issue](https://github.com/jaysnm/r-base/issues) to discuss your proposed addition or change  
- Send your `pull request`. 
- If you are writing a new `Dockerfile`, be sure to follow the [best practices guide](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
- Read documentation of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
